title="Permalink"></a></h1><p><em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em> incorporates two fundamental concepts that serve as the foundation of the optimization model:</p><ul><li><strong>Energy Assets</strong>: representation of a physical asset that can produce, consume, store, balance, or convert energy. Some examples of what these assets can represent are:<ul><li>Producer: e.g., wind turbine, solar panel</li><li>Consumer: e.g., electricity demand, heat demand</li><li>Storage: e.g., battery, pumped-hydro storage</li><li>Balancing Hub: e.g., an electricity network that serves as a connection among other energy assets</li><li>Conversion: e.g., power plants, electrolyzers</li></ul></li><li><strong>Flows</strong>: representation of the connections among assets, e.g., pipelines, transmission lines, or just simply the energy production that goes from one asset to another.</li></ul><p>The model guarantees a balance of energy for the various types of assets while considering the flow limits. The <a href="../mathematical-formulation/#math-formulation"><code>mathematical formulation</code></a> defines the flow variable (<span>$v^{flow}_{f,rp,k}$</span>) as the instantaneous value (e.g., power in MW) for each flow <span>$f$</span> between two assets, representative period <span>$rp$</span>, and time step <span>$k$</span>. The time step <span>$k$</span> can represent a single time step (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) or a range of time steps (e.g., 1:3, meaning that the variable represents the value of time steps 1, 2 and 3). For more examples and details on this topic, refer to the section on <a href="#flex-time-res">flexible time resolution</a>.</p><p>The following sections explain the main features of the optimization model based on all these concepts and definitions.</p><h2 id="flex-asset-connection"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#flex-asset-connection">Flexible Connection of Energy Assets</a><a id="flex-asset-connection-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#flex-asset-connection" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The representation of the energy system in <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em> is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>, which deals with the connection between vertices by edges. This representation provides a more flexible framework to model <em>energy assets</em> in the system as <em>vertices</em>, and to model <em>flows</em> between energy assets as <em>edges</em>. In addition, it reduces the model size. For instance, connecting assets directly to each other, without having a node in between, allows us to reduce the number of variables and constraints to represent different configurations. For instance, it is becoming more and more common to have hybrid assets like <code>storage + renewable</code> (e.g., battery + solar), <code>electrolyzer + renewable</code> (e.g., electrolyzer + wind), or <code>renewable + hydro</code> (e.g., solar + hydro) that are located in the same site and share a common connection point to the grid. In hybrid configurations, for example, flows from the grid are typically not allowed as they either avoid charging from the grid or require green hydrogen production.</p><p>Consider the following example to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. In the classic connection approach, the nodes play a crucial role in modelling. For example, every asset needs to be connected to a node with balance constraints. When a storage asset and a renewable asset are in a hybrid connection like the one described before, a connection point is needed to connect the hybrid configuration to the rest of the system. Therefore, to consider the hybrid configuration of a storage asset and a renewable asset, we must introduce a node (i.e., a connection point) between these assets and the external power grid (i.e., a balance point), as shown in the following figure:</p><p><img src="../figs/flexible-connection-1.png" alt="Classic connection"/></p><p>In this system, the <code>phs</code> storage asset charges and discharges from the <code>connection point</code>, while the <code>wind</code> turbine produces power that also goes directly to the <code>connection point</code>. This <code>connection point</code> is connected to the external power grid through a transmission line that leads to a <code>balance</code> hub with/connecting to other assets. Essentially, the <code>connection point</code> acts as a balancing hub point for the assets in this hybrid configuration. Furthermore, these hybrid configurations impose an additional constraint to ensure that storage charges from the power grid are avoided. The section with <a href="#comparison"><code>comparison of different modeling approaches</code></a> shows the quantification of these reductions.</p><p>Let&#39;s consider the modelling approach in <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em>. As nodes are no longer needed to connect assets, we can connect them directly to each other as shown in the figure below:</p><p><img src="../figs/flexible-connection-2.png" alt="Flexible connection"/></p><p>By implementing this approach, we can reduce the number of variables and constraints involved in the process. For example, the balance constraint in the intermediate node is no longer needed, as well as the extra constraint to avoid the storage charging from the power grid.  Additionally, we can eliminate the variable that determines the flow between the intermediate node and the power grid because the flow from <code>phs</code> to <code>balance</code> can directly link to the external grid.</p><p>The example here shows the connection of a <code>phs</code> and a <code>wind</code> asset, illustrating the modelling approach&#39;s advantages and the example&#39;s reusability in the following sections. However, other applications of these co-location (or hybrid) combinations of assets are battery-solar, hydro-solar, and electrolyzer-wind.</p><h2 id="flex-time-res"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#flex-time-res">Flexible Time Resolution</a><a id="flex-time-res-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#flex-time-res" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>One of the core features of <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em> is that it can handle different time resolutions on the assets and the flows. Typically, the time resolution in an energy model is hourly like in the following figure where we have a six-hour energy system:</p><p><img src="../figs/variable-time-resolution-1.png" alt="Hourly Time Resolution"/></p><p>Therefore, for this simple example we can determine the number of constraints and variables in the optimization problem:</p><ul><li><p><em>Number of variables</em>: 42 since we have six connections among assets (i.e., 6 flows x 6 hours = 36 variables) and one storage asset (i.e., 6 storage level x 6 h = 6 variables)</p></li><li><p><em>Number of constraints</em>: 72, where:</p><ul><li>24 from the maximum output limit of the assets that produce, convert, or discharge energy (i.e., <code>H2</code>, <code>wind</code>, <code>ccgt</code>, and <code>phs</code>) for each hour (i.e., 4 assets x 6 h = 24 constraints)</li><li>6 from the maximum input limit of the storage or charging limit for the <code>phs</code></li><li>6 from the maximum storage level limit for the <code>phs</code></li><li>12 from the import and export limits for the transmission line between the <code>balance</code> hub and the <code>demand</code></li><li>24 from the energy balance on the consumer, hub, conversion, and storage assets (i.e., <code>demand</code>, <code>balance</code>, <code>ccgt</code>, and <code>phs</code>) for each hour (i.e., 4 assets x 6 h = 24 constraints)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Depending on the input data and the level of detail you want to model, hourly resolution in all the variables might not be necessary. <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em> has the possibility to have different time resolutions for each asset and flow to simplify the optimization problem and approximate hourly representation. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale energy systems that involve different sectors, as detailed granularity is not always necessary due to the unique temporal dynamics of each sector. For instance, we can use hourly resolution for the electricity sector and six-hour resolution for the hydrogen sector. We can couple multiple sectors, each with its temporal resolution.</p><p>Let&#39;s explore the flexibility in the time resolution with the following examples. The following table shows the user input data for the asset time resolution definition. Please note that the values presented in this example are just for illustrative purposes and do not represent a realistic case.</p><div><div style = "float: left;"><span>2×4 DataFrame</span></div><div style = "clear: both;"></div></div><div class = "data-frame" style = "overflow-x: scroll;"><table class = "data-frame" style = "margin-bottom: 6px;"><thead><tr class = "header"><th class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">Row</th><th style = "text-align: left;">asset</th><th style = "text-align: left;">rep_period_id</th><th style = "text-align: left;">specification</th><th style = "text-align: left;">partition</th></tr><tr class = "subheader headerLastRow"><th class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;"></th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th><th title = "Int64" style = "text-align: left;">Int64</th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th><th title = "Int64" style = "text-align: left;">Int64</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">H2</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">uniform</td><td style = "text-align: right;">6</td></tr><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">2</td><td style = "text-align: left;">phs</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">uniform</td><td style = "text-align: right;">6</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The definitions for the assets are determined in a file called <a href="../how-to-use/#asset-partitions-definition"><code>assets-partitions.csv</code></a>. For instance, the example in the file shows that both the <code>H2</code> producer and the <code>phs</code> storage have a <code>uniform</code> definition of 6 hours. This means that we want to represent the <code>H2</code> production profile and the storage level of the <code>phs</code> every six hours.</p><p>If an asset is not specified in this file, the balance equation will be written in the lowest resolution of both incoming and outgoing flows to the asset. For example, the incoming and outgoing flows to the hub asset (<code>balance</code>) will determine how often the balance constraint is written.</p><p>The same type of definition can be done for the flows, for example (again, the values are for illustrative purposes and do not represent a realistic case):</p><div><div style = "float: left;"><span>5×5 DataFrame</span></div><div style = "clear: both;"></div></div><div class = "data-frame" style = "overflow-x: scroll;"><table class = "data-frame" style = "margin-bottom: 6px;"><thead><tr class = "header"><th class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">Row</th><th style = "text-align: left;">from_asset</th><th style = "text-align: left;">to_asset</th><th style = "text-align: left;">rep_period_id</th><th style = "text-align: left;">specification</th><th style = "text-align: left;">partition</th></tr><tr class = "subheader headerLastRow"><th class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;"></th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th><th title = "Int64" style = "text-align: left;">Int64</th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th><th title = "InlineStrings.String7" style = "text-align: left;">String7</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">H2</td><td style = "text-align: left;">ccgt</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">uniform</td><td style = "text-align: left;">6</td></tr><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">2</td><td style = "text-align: left;">wind</td><td style = "text-align: left;">balance</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">math</td><td style = "text-align: left;">1x2+1x4</td></tr><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">3</td><td style = "text-align: left;">wind</td><td style = "text-align: left;">phs</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">uniform</td><td style = "text-align: left;">3</td></tr><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">4</td><td style = "text-align: left;">phs</td><td style = "text-align: left;">balance</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">math</td><td style = "text-align: left;">1x4+1x2</td></tr><tr><td class = "rowNumber" style = "font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">5</td><td style = "text-align: left;">balance</td><td style = "text-align: left;">demand</td><td style = "text-align: right;">1</td><td style = "text-align: left;">uniform</td><td style = "text-align: left;">3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These definitions are determined in the <a href="../how-to-use/#flow-partitions-definition"><code>flows-partitions.csv</code></a> file. The example shows a <code>uniform</code> definition for the flow from the hydrogen producer (<code>H2</code>) to the conversion asset (<code>ccgt</code>) of six hours, from the wind producer (<code>wind</code>) to the storage (<code>phs</code>) of three hours, and from the balance hub (<code>balance</code>) to the consumer (<code>demand</code>) of three hours, too. In addition, the flow from the wind producer (<code>wind</code>) to the balance hub (<code>balance</code>) is defined using the <code>math</code> specification of <code>1x2+1x4</code>, meaning that there are two time blocks, one of two hours (i.e., <code>1:2</code>) and another of four hours (i.e., <code>3:6</code>). Finally, the flow from the storage (<code>phs</code>) to the balance hub (<code>balance</code>) is defined using the <code>math</code> specification of <code>1x4+1x2</code>, meaning that there are two time blocks, one of four hours (i.e., <code>1:4</code>) and another of two hours (i.e., <code>5:6</code>).</p><p>If a flow is not specified in this file, the flow time resolution will be for each time step by default (e.g., hourly). For instance, the flow from the <code>ccgt</code> to the hub <code>balance</code> will be written hourly in this example.</p><p>The following figure illustrates these definition on the example.</p><p><img src="../figs/variable-time-resolution-2.png" alt="Variable Time Resolution"/></p><p>So, let&#39;s recap:</p><ul><li>The hydrogen producer (<code>H2</code>) is in a six-hour resolution represented by the range <code>1:6</code>, meaning that the balance of the hydrogen produced is for every six hours.</li><li>The flow from the hydrogen producer to the ccgt power plant (<code>H2,ccgt</code>) is also in a six-hour resolution <code>1:6</code>.</li><li>The flow from the ccgt power plant to the balance hub (<code>ccgt,balance</code>) is in an hourly resolution <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6]</code>.</li><li>The <code>ccgt</code> is a conversion plant that takes hydrogen to produce electricity. Since both sectors are in different time resolutions. The energy balance in the conversion asset is done in the lowest resolution connecting to the asset. In this case, the energy balance in the <code>ccgt</code> is done every six hours, i.e., in the range <code>1:6</code>.</li><li>The <code>wind</code> producer has an hourly profile of electricity production, so the resolution of the asset is still hourly.</li><li>The <code>wind</code> producer output has two connections, one to the <code>balance</code> hub and the other to the pumped-hydro storage (<code>phs</code>) with different resolutions:<ul><li>The flow from the wind producer to the phs storage (<code>wind,phs</code>) has a uniform resolution of two blocks from hour 1 to 3 (i.e., <code>1:3</code>) and from hour 4 to 6 (i.e., <code>4:6</code>).</li><li>The flow from the wind producer to the balance hub (<code>wind,balance</code>) has a variable resolution of two blocks, too, but from hour 1 to 2 (i.e., <code>1:2</code>) and from hour 3 to 6 (i.e., <code>3:6</code>).</li></ul></li><li>The <code>phs</code> is in a six-hour resolution represented by the range <code>1:6</code>, meaning the storage balance is determined every six hours.</li><li>The flow from the phs to the balance (<code>phs,balance</code>) represents the discharge of the <code>phs</code>. This flow has a variable resolution of two blocks from hour 1 to 4 (i.e., <code>1:4</code>) and from hour 5 to 6 (i.e., <code>5:6</code>), which differs from the one defined for the charging flow from the <code>wind</code> asset.</li><li>The <code>demand</code> consumption has hourly input data with one connection to the <code>balance</code> hub:<ul><li>The flow from the balance hub to the demand (<code>balance,demand</code>) has a uniform resolution of three hours; therefore, it has two blocks, one from hour 1 to 3 (i.e., <code>1:3</code>) and the other from hour 4 to 6 (i.e., <code>4:6</code>).</li></ul></li><li>The <code>balance</code> hub integrates all the different assets with their different resolutions. The lowest resolution of all connections determines the balance equation for this asset. Therefore, the resulting resolution is into two blocks, one from hour 1 to 4 (i.e., <code>1:4</code>) and the other from hour 5 to 6 (i.e., <code>5:6</code>). Notice that the resulting resolution comes from using the function <a href="../reference/#TulipaEnergyModel.compute_rp_partition-Tuple{AbstractVector{&lt;:AbstractVector{&lt;:UnitRange{&lt;:Integer}}}, Any}"><code>compute_rp_partition</code></a>, which applies a <code>:greedy</code> forward strategy to obtain the lowest resolution of all connecting assets. It is possible that other strategies, such as the backward strategy, could be helpful. However, these are outside the current scope of the model and may be the subject of future research.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> This example demonstrates that different time resolutions can be assigned to each asset and flow in the model. Additionally, the resolutions do not need to be uniform and can vary throughout the horizon.</p></blockquote><p>The complete input data for this example can be found in the following <a href="https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/TulipaEnergyModel.jl/tree/main/test/inputs/Variable%20Resolution">link</a>.</p><p>For this basic example, we can describe what the balance and capacity constraints in the model look like.

So, let us consider three different approaches based on the same example:</p><ol><li>Classic approach with hourly resolution: This approach needs an extra asset, called <code>node</code>, to create the hybrid operation of the <code>phs</code> and <code>wind</code> assets.</li><li>Flexible connection with hourly resolution: This approach uses the flexible connection to represent the hybrid operation of the  <code>phs</code> and <code>wind</code> assets.</li><li>Flexible connection and time resolution: This approach uses both features, the flexible connection and the flexible time resolution.</li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em> is flexible enough to allow any of these three approaches to the model through the input data.</p></blockquote><p>The table below shows the number of constraints and variables for each approach over a six-hour horizon. This highlights the potential of flexible time resolution in reducing the size of the optimization model.</p><table><tr><th style="text-align: left">Modeling approach</th><th style="text-align: left">Nº Variables</th><th style="text-align: left">Nº Constraints</th><th style="text-align: left">Objective Function</th></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">Classic approach with hourly resolution</td><td style="text-align: left">48</td><td style="text-align: left">84</td><td style="text-align: left">28.4365</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">Flexible connection with hourly resolution</td><td style="text-align: left">42</td><td style="text-align: left">72</td><td style="text-align: left">28.4365</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left">Flexible connection and time resolution</td><td style="text-align: left">16</td><td style="text-align: left">25</td><td style="text-align: left">28.4587</td></tr></table><p>By comparing the classic approach with the other methods, we can analyze their differences:</p><ul><li>The flexible connection with hourly resolution reduces 6 variables (<span>$12.5\%$</span>) and 12 constraints (<span>$\approx 14\%$</span>). The objective function is the same since in both cases we use an hourly time resolution.</li><li>The combination of features reduces 32 variables (<span>$\approx 67\%$</span>) and 59 constraints (<span>$\approx 70\%$</span>) with an approximation error of <span>$\approx 0.073\%$</span>.</li></ul><p>The level of reduction and approximation error will depend on each case. The example demonstrates the potential for reduction and accuracy using the flexible time resolution feature in <em>TulipaEnergyModel.jl</em>. Some use cases for this feature include:</p><ul><li><p>Coupling different energy sectors with different dynamics. For instance, methane, hydrogen, and heat sectors can be represented in energy models with lower resolutions (e.g. 4, 6, or 12h) than the electricity sector, usually modeled in higher resolutions (e.g., 1h, 30 min).</p></li><li><p>It may not be necessary to have highly detailed resolutions for all your assets in a large-scale electricity case study. For example, if you are analyzing a European case study that focuses on a specific country like The Netherlands, you may not require hourly details for distant countries. However, you would still want to consider their effect, such as Portugal and Spain. In such cases, flexible time resolution can help you maintain hourly details for assets in your focus country while reducing the detail in distant countries by increasing their resolution to two hours or more, depending on the desired level of accuracy. This will reduce the variables in the assets of the distant country.</p></li></ul></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../">« Home</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../mathematical-formulation/">Mathematical Formulation »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.2.1 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Thursday 22 February 2024 15:47">Thursday 22 February 2024</span>.
