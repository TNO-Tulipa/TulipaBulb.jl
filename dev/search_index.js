The inter-temporal constraints help to characterize the long-term operational dynamics of the assets (e.g., seasonality). So far, the model uses this type of constraint to model seasonal storage.

The standard method of modeling these assets requires extra variables and constraints for them to function correctly.

Since both sectors have different time resolutions, the energy balance in the conversion asset is defined in the lowest resolution connecting to the asset. In this case, the energy balance in the ccgt is defined every 6 hours, i.e., in the range 1:6.\nThe wind producer has an hourly profile of electricity production, so the resolution of the asset is hourly.\nThe wind producer output has two connections, one to the balance hub and the other to the pumped-hydro storage (phs) with different resolutions:\nThe flow from the wind producer to the phs storage (wind, phs) has a uniform resolution of two blocks from hours 1 to 3 (i.e., 1:3) and from hours 4 to 6 (i.e., 4:6).\nThe flow from the wind producer to the balance hub (wind, balance) has a variable resolution of two blocks, too, but from hours 1 to 2 (i.e., 1:2) and from hours 3 to 6 (i.e., 3:6).\nThe phs is in a 6-hour resolution represented by the range 1:6, meaning the storage balance is determined every 6 hours.\nThe flow from the phs to the balance (phs, balance) represents the discharge of the phs.

For instance, methane, hydrogen, and heat sectors can be represented in energy models with lower resolutions (e.g., 4, 6, or 12h) than the electricity sector, usually modeled in higher resolutions (e.g., 1h, 30 min).\nHaving high resolutions for all assets in a large-scale case study may not be necessary. For example, if analyzing a European case study focusing on a specific country like The Netherlands, hourly details for distant countries (such as Portugal and Spain) may not be required. However, one would still want to consider their effect on The Netherlands without causing too much computational burden. In such cases, flexible time resolution can maintain hourly details in the focus country, while reducing the detail in distant countries by increasing their resolution (to two hours or more). This reduction allows a broader scope without over-burdening computation.","category":"page"},{"location":"concepts/#storage-modeling","page":"Concepts","title":"Storage Modeling","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"concepts/","page":"Concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"Energy storage systems can be broadly classified into two categories: seasonal and non-seasonal storage.
