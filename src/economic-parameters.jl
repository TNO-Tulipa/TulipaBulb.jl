    calculate_annualized_cost(discount_rate, economic_lifetime, investment_cost, years, investable_assets)

Calculates the annualized cost for each asset, both energy assets and transport assets, in each year using provided discount rates, economic lifetimes, and investment costs.

# Arguments
- `discount_rate::Dict`: A dictionary where the key is an `asset` or a pair of assets `(asset1, asset2)` for transport assets, and the value is the discount rate.
- `economic_lifetime::Dict`: A dictionary where the key is an `asset` or a pair of assets `(asset1, asset2)` for transport assets, and the value is the economic lifetime.
- `investment_cost::Dict`: A dictionary where the key is an `asset` or a pair of assets `(asset1, asset2)` for transport assets, and the value is the investment cost.
- `years::Array`: An array of years to be considered.
- `investable_assets::Dict`: A dictionary where the key is a year, and the value is an array of assets that are relevant for that year.

# Returns
- A `Dict` where the keys are tuples `(year, asset)` representing the year and the asset, and the values are the calculated annualized cost for each asset in each year.

# Formula
The annualized cost for each asset in year is calculated using the formula:

    annualized_cost = discount_rate[asset] / (
        (1 + discount_rate[asset]) *
        (1 - 1 / (1 + discount_rate[asset])^economic_lifetime[asset])
    ) * investment_cost[(year, asset)]
